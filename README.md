This is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. The record are in six csv files. I design the tables to hold data in the CSVS and imported into a SQL database and performed the following queries:

  - List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
  - List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
  - List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
  - List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  - List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
  - List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  - List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  - In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
